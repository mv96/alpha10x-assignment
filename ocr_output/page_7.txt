EV Battery Recycling Market Drivers - Macro Policy Guidance

After years of development, battery recycling policies and legislation in developed countries are complete with stricter requirements; China has
significantly accelerated the introduction of battery recycling policies over the past decade, aiming to promote and ensure the construction of recycling
systems and guide the standardized and integrated development of the industry

/ Policy and legislative systems in developed countries started early and are relatively mature / / China’s policy guidance has been strengthened in recent years /
