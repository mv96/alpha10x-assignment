Business Model: OEM-led Industrial Alliance as Recycler

The industrial alliance model could be an ideal business model and is led mainly by OEMs. By leveraging the distribution service network and recycling

technology of the member enterprises in the industrial chain, the recycling alliance can achieve a cost-effective and scalable recycling business and reduce
vicious competition in the market. However, this model is still in the initial trial stage of commercial operation, given that various stakeholders are involved

Business model analysis

The industrial chain’s upstream and downstream alliance members
are the primary recycler of EV batteries. The alliance is the inevitable
consequence of the Extended Producer Responsibility and the
industrial collaborative cooperation mode driven by recycling
economics. OEMs often adopt this mode to build a recycling network
through alliances to form a closed loop of the industrial chain.

Extensive recycling channels and strong technical expertise. Through
industrial collaboration, the vicious competition in the market, the cost
of vehicle production, battery manufacturing and material recycling
has been effectively reduced, and the overall recycling efficiency and
mode operation efficiency have been improved

The negative impact of risk sharing is evident in this model. Members
are bound by each other through industrial alliances. Enterprises need

to bear the potential risks that other members of the battery recycling
chain may bring, like uneven expertise.
