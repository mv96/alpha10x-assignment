Impact of upstream lithium battery and NEV industry trends on EV battery recycling

As the upstream industry, the technology and market trend of lithium battery and NEV industry are closely interrelated to the EV battery recycling

Related Trends of the EV battery recycling upstream industry

Impact on EV battery recycling industry

Rising prices of raw >
materials

The productivity growth of upstream metal resource exploitation is lower than
that of downstream application industries, and the mismatch between resource
supply and demand is significant, leading to metal price fluctuations

The critical metals in battery manufacturing can be recycled from end-of-life
batteries, effectively supplement the shortage of resources, and promote the
development of the recycling industry from the demand side

Rapid iteration of »>
battery chemistry .

High nickelization and low cobalt of ternary batteries and Li-battery
alternatives, which correspondingly reduce the dependence on precious
elements through material innovation, are global R&D hot topics.

The installation of LFP battery increases rapidly due to its cost and safety
advantages

The fast innovation of battery technology and the diversity of specifications raise
the difficulty of battery disassembly and recycling

The cost reduction trend of batteries may bring challenges to the profitability of
the recycling industry, promote recycling companies to develop more efficient
recycling technologies and models

Battery pack technologies such as module-free design (CTP) and battery chassis
integration technology (CTC) improve space utilization and mileage range and
achieve high efficiency and cost reduction

Groundswell of the opinion of EV and battery pack standardization, but
standardization itself is proceeding slowly.

Highly integrated and structural batteries have increased the difficulty of
battery disassembly and technical barriers to recovery. The vehicle companies
and their partners will take on greater responsibility for recycling

The standardization of battery packs will benefit the automatic disassembly
process of batteries, promoting the standardization process of battery recycling

Battery Bank (BaaS) and other on-demand battery replacement service provide
centralized full life-cycle operation management such as battery leasing,
charging, maintenance and swapping

The rise of battery services has led to a more centralized recycling channel,
making it easy to create a scale effect

Battery banks, charging stations are conducive to strengthening the information
traceability and management of the battery life cycle, accurately predicting
battery retirement, improving the battery recycling efficiency and values
