Recycle: Prospects of Battery Recycling in Different Chemical Systems

The distinctions in battery chemical structure and properties determine the recycling mode, reuse method, value and market size of end-of-life EV batteries.
The development of reuse of LFP is restricted to the current conditions, and the future recycling market is expected to be dominated by the direct recycle
of ternary (NMC) batteries

* LFP batteries are more suitable for reusing due to their relatively low material cost,

good stability and long lifespan

NMC batteries are more suitable for recycling due to their relatively high material
cost, poor stability and short lifespan.

The development of NMC batteries starts later than LFP, and the recovery rate also lagged. End-of-
life LFP batteries are more suitable for reuse. However, reuse has not yet achieved technical
breakthroughs currently, and it is challenging to achieve economies of scale. It is projected that the
recycling market of NMC batteries will continue to lead in the short and medium term.
