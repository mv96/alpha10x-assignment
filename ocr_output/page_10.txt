Reuse: Development Limitation Factors

The reuse industry has significant development limitations and bottlenecks at the current stage. The downstream application development is expected to
be slow before the policy system is improved and the industry standard is established

national regulatory system and local implementation

the policy intends to promote reuse, it also emphasizes the
importance of strict management of the safety of EV battery reuse,

The policy management system for the reuse of EV batteries is still in

* Policy guidance maintains a moderately positive attitude: Although

and is especially cautious towards reuse in energy storage scenarios.

Market Factor

Demand side - uncertain potential:

Low acceptance in the downstream market: Due to unclear standards
and immature regulatory system, frequent accidents of battery reused
for energy storage have led to low market acceptance. Users are
concerned about the safety and consistency of reused batteries
Impact of potential alternative products: the rise of sodium-ion
batteries and fuel cells and other technologies may replace and
squeeze the market of LFP batteries for secondary use

Supply side - “bad money drives out good”:

Long-standing market confusion: In the absence of effective
regulation, many non-compliant small workshops have long been
entrenched in the reuse market, and it is difficult for enterprises with
high investments to profit and survive in the vicious competition

Key technologies to be broken through, industry standards to be
established: The battery life-cycle traceability management and
industry-standard system are to be established, and technical
problems still exist in several sectors of the reuse technology process

Evaluation and sorting - Battery specifications are complex, and life
evaluation is difficult

Detection and screening - Lack of battery use records, complicated
detecting technology

Restructuring - High technical barriers to battery consistency

product certification is difficult

The current market situation: the current commercialization cases of EV battery reuse are few. Most of the projects are pilot programs, with only a few regular enterprises with qualifications participating,
such as GEM, China Tower, etc.; the current reuse market is not yet standardized and in chaos. Market confusion caused by non-compliant small workshops forces the regular enterprises into a dilemma,
which makes the market less attractive to enterprises that have not entered, and the market is difficult to scale up in the short term
