Challenge-facing EV battery recycling industry

Technical challenges and market mechanism challenges coexist in the recycling industry. Thus, many problems are still to be solved in each sector of the EV
battery recycling industry chain. The healthy development of the EV battery recycling market is in urgent need of the guidance of macro policies and the
joint efforts of all individual parties in the industry chain

@ Difficulties in channel construction @ High cost of reintegration and utilization @ Price uncertainty of raw materials
Establishing a stable recycling channel is one of the recycling Only after disassembly, screening, re-integration, and other processes The price of recycled materials is affected by
companies’ most crucial success factors. The establishment can the end-of-life batteries that meet the standard be put into reuse. the double influence of the cost of recycling
problem of the recycling channel significantly exposed due to the In addition, a series of costs such as battery management and logistics end-of-life batteries and the cost generated
asymmetric information between the upstream enterprises with transportation lead to limited profit margins from the recycling process. The frequent
battery resources and the downstream recycling companies fluctuation of the price of metal raw materials
will also affect the attractiveness of recycled
materials, and the uncertainty of the price
poses severe challenges to the downstream
application of recycled materials

Uncertain downstream demand due to security concerns
Subjected to the application scenarios and the application enterprise’s
concern about the potential safety hazard of secondary battery
utilization, the reuse of end-of-life batteries is weaker than expected

Recycling cost challenges

At present, pricing mechanisms for the recycled end-of-life
batteries are lacking, and the poor transparency causes the new
batteries materials purchasing prices to drop away from the resale
prices of recycled materials

Lack of standards

Technical challenges of battery diversity

Types of power batteries are varied, from battery materials to
internal structures and assembly techniques. The lack of unified
standards poses challenges to the evaluation of end-of-life batteries

Data source barriers

Third-party recyclers are challenging to obtain the data of end-of-
life batteries from vehicle or battery manufacturers, which
increases the difficulty of battery state estimation, remaining useful
life prediction and safety assessment

The disassembly and recovery technology process directly affect the
recovery rate of high-value metals. The diversity of batteries will also
bring technical difficulties. Moreover, the company needs to address
the energy consumption and the environmental impact of the process

Difficulty to scale up due to unstable recycling channels

The massive investment in capacity construction in the early stage
requires the companies to reach a specific scale of recycling end-of-life
batteries to avoid significant profit pressure
