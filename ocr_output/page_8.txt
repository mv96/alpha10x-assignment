Driving Factor of Battery Recycling Market: The Upcoming Trend of EV Battery Retirement

The retirement tide of EV batteries has promoted the gradual release of recyclable battery waste and driven the development of the global lithium
recycling market, with the volume of end-of-life batteries and process scraps rising at a CAGR of 43% over the next decade; The Chinese market, which

leads the global EV market, is also expected to usher in considerable growth in the field of Li-battery recycling

¢ With the vigorous development of the global EV market, the installed capacity of EV batteries has risen rapidly. The service life of EV batteries is about 5-8 years. Therefore, the first batch of
batteries put into the market has ushered in a “retirement tide”, especially in the Chinese market, where the production output and sales of EVs and EV batteries have soared since 2015.

¢ End-of-life batteries are the primary “raw materials” for EV battery recycling. The advent of the EV battery retirement tide will continue to provide recyclable waste for the Li-battery recycling.
