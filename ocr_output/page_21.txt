Third-party Battery Recyclers: Li-Cycle (2/2)

GLi-cycte

Li-Cycle equipped the closed-loop recycling technology from end-of-life batteries to renewable materials and accelerates the improvement of recovery

capacity to achieve vertical integration of resources

/ Segmented business plan to cover full battery recycle process /

Li-Cycle recycles end-of-life batteries to achieve battery full life-cycle coverage through the “Spoke &
Hub” network, provides customers with sustainable solutions for lithium-ion batteries, and creates the
path to a closed-loop supply chain to support the secondary supply of key battery materials

Spoke: Flexible battery processing facility

* Recycle and handle the preliminary processing of end-of-
life batteries through shredding, separation and other
mechanical processes to produce black mass that creates
major economic value

* The Spoke is a decentralized and flexible-planning facility
° that processes batteries close to the supply source

° Hub: Centralized hydrometallurgical processing center

* Recover black mass into battery-grade raw materials
through hydrometallurgical process for reuse in Li-battery
production, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and more

* The Hub isa centralized facility for large-scale production
of specialty materials that achieve economies of scale in
recycling but with a high initial investment and
environmental control cost

* Li-Cycleis actively investing in and building the Spoke and Hub facilities to improve the scale of the battery recycling business. Li-Cycle is expected to have up to 20 Spoke facilities, 3 ternary lithium battery Hub
facilities and 1 LFP lithium battery Hub facility by 2025. The first Hub facility in Rochester, New York, is projected to have a battery materials processing capacity equivalent to 225,000 EVs every year
