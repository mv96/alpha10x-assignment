Development Trend of Li-battery and NEV Industrial Chain

With the transformation of the industry to market-driven development, the lithium battery and NEV industry will further evolve from a chained-form to a
mesh ecology with deeper cooperation and mutual empowerment, in which each sector of the industry chain shows the trend of extending to battery
recycling in various forms and different degrees
