Recycle: Mainstream Battery-grade Material Extraction Techniques

Recycling enterprises generally refine the valuable metals in end-of-life EV batteries through hydro or pyro-metallurgy, which are highly-technical maturity
and with clear steps, while other emerging processes, such as biological processes and supercritical CO, extraction, are still in the early stages of research
and development; currently, in China, EV battery recycling enterprises’ processes are mainly based on hydro

Use high-temperature to convert metal oxides end-of-life in battery
materials to metals or metal compounds, which proceeds to condensation
and refining. Pyro has high compatibility and is applicable to large-scale

recycling of various types of end-of-life Li-batteries.

* Use acids to dissolve the metal components of batteries and then separate
the constituent elements as inorganic salts and metallic oxide through

solvent extractions, chemical precipitation, and electrolysis steps. Hydro is
suitable for the recycling of small and medium-scale end-of-life batteries.

Process
characteristics

Low cost and energy-efficient High investment and energy-intensive

The recovery rate is relatively lower, but is capable of recovering various
heavy metals such as Hg and Zn

Relatively more complicated, and needs to be adjusted Simpler pretreatment methods but not effective for Lithium-iron-
optimized for certain battery chemistries phosphate (LFP) batteries
