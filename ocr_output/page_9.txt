Recycling Methods of EV Battery

Reuse and direct recycle are the most generally acceptable and environmentally friendly methods of batteries disposal. Large-scale applications of EV
battery reuse is challenging, and EV battery recycling might be dominated by direct recycle in the medium and long term

/ Reuse: utilization of the residual capacity of battery / / Recycle: recovery of metal materials and other resources /

recycled by dismantling, batte Recycled by
shredding and sorting extracting methods
+ Increase value: optimize the utilization of batteries and maximize the residual value + High recovery rate: Mature in technology, thus the resource recovery rate is high
+ Cost reduction: reduce the cost of energy storage, low-speed electric vehicles and + Simple process: The process is more straightforward than reuse, and there is no need
other related industries, and promote the development of the circular economy for screening and safety assessment
+ Reduce pollution: effectively reduce the pollution of waste lithium-ion batteries and + Complementary techniques: a combined approach can be applied to improve the
reduce waste of resources economic benefits of recycling and solve the problem of energy over-consumption
— Applicable limitations: not suitable for ternary (NMC) lithium battery, difficulty to — Cost issues: The pyro has a large investment and high energy consumption in the early
maintain economies of scale subject to many qualifications stage, while the hydro is relative time-consuming
— Inefficiency: The evaluation process of batteries is time-consuming and inefficient — Environmental pollution: Both pyro and hydro cause severe environmental pollution
— Potential safety risks: The internal safety hazards of retired batteries are highly easily, and the requirements for pollution treatment are high
concealed, which affects the remaining life and safety of the battery pack — Uncertainty: Emerging techniques such as biological processes and supercritical CO,

extraction are still in startup
