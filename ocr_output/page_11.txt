Recycle: Process Flow of EV Battery Recycle

The main challenge of power battery dismantling and recycling lies in the instability of front-end battery recycling channels that make it difficult to scale up
the production of back-end battery grade raw material refining

The instability and high cost due to the highly-fragmented battery The mechanical process and the metal refining process after the pretreatment of the battery pack have been relatively mature, can
