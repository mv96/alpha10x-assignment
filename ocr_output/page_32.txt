Based on the company’s strategic consideration and its capability’s current situation, should the company get involved in battery recycling?

If entering the recycling field, does it involve reuse or recycling? How can the company take advantage of the technology of the original car
manufacturing business?

Which industry sectors should the company plan to engage in? What is the core business objective? Is it to do independent recycling capability
R&D or seek industrial collaborations up and downstream based on the original business?

Capabilities development:

Channel - How to improve the utilization of the existing sales network and establish a recycling channel for retired batteries with stable sources
and guaranteed quality to avoid losing resources to other third-party channels?

Technology - Assess the current status of its own capabilities, including gaps in battery recycling technology capabilities, and its supply of retired
batteries, and determine the depth of its involvement in battery recycling?

Economic - Based on the cost-effectiveness of possible business models, further decide how to achieve technical capacity building: self-R&D,
partnership, or M&A?

Industrial synergy:

Upstream - Is it possible that the supply constraints of upstream materials be alleviated through the recycling business? Whether and how do
OEMs seek cooperation with upstream battery and material companies to obtain technical capabilities?

Downstream - How do OEMs cooperate with downstream recycling companies to supplement the battery recycling network? Is it possible to
cooperate with energy and power suppliers to expand the reuse scenario when the technology and business model are mature?
