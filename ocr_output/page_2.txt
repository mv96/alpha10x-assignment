Key Takeaways

With the rapid growth of global new energy vehicle industry, the upstream resource constraint has become one of the burning issues. While various countries continue to perfect the EV battery
recycling policy system under the carbon neutral requirements, the EV battery recycling industry has been flourishing, and the upcoming battery retirement tide will further drive the development of
the EV battery recycling industry. The EV battery recycling market is promising in technology development, business model, and industry chain synergy, but there are still many key challenges.

From the technology development perspective, the process and technical route of EV battery recycling is relatively clear. Based on actual business expectations,
direct recycle will dominate the recovery method in the medium- to long-term:

The two main ways of EV battery recycling are reuse and direct recycle. The large-scale development of reuse faces enormous challenges due to safety issues, insufficient market regulation, the

impact of vicious competition, and the lack of industry standards. In the medium- to long-term, recycle with relatively mature technologies and commercial applications is expected to be the
dominant approach

In the material recovery process, pyro- and hydro-metallurgy are the mainstream battery-grade raw material purification and regeneration techniques, which has high technical and scale

barriers, while creating higher economic benefits, leading companies need to address the supply stability of front-end battery recycling channels and actively layout raw material recycling
capacity to achieve higher commercial value

@ From the business model perspective, third-party and battery manufacturer recycling have been well-practiced. The construction of recycling networks and
closed-loop regeneration are essential success factors:

The market mechanism is the main challenge for the current development of the EV battery recycling industry. It forces the leading recycler enterprises to enhance their scale and break
through the profitability bottleneck

Third-party recycling companies have the advantage of recycling technology, while battery manufacturers and automotive OEMs gained the advantage of recycling and resale channels; in the
current EV battery recycling market, the key to successful business models lies in the construction of recycling channel networks and a closed-loop ecology for recycling materials for reuse

From the industry chain synergy perspective, the multiple sectors of the Li-battery and NEV industry chain have shown the trend of extending to battery recycling
in different forms and degrees:

Upstream lithium and new energy vehicle industry technology and market trends, such as battery material innovation, integration technology, battery banks, etc., bring impact to the power
battery recycling industry, and opportunities and challenges coexist

An industry alliance of upstream and downstream enterprises in the industry chain may be an ideal model for the recycling industry, as each member enterprise can complement each other’s
strengths and weaknesses for mutual benefits. However, due to the long industry chain and many stakeholders involved, the model is still in the exploration stage of actual commercial operation
