Raw materials Recycle Reuse

* According to the company’s statistics, in the first quarter of 2022, a total of 21,300 tonnes of end-of-life batteries have been recycled and used to produce 18,000 tonnes of battery precursors,
and the advantages of the internal circulation system will gradually create a marked effect.

* The establishment of Brunp integrated industrial park is conducive to further improve the CATL’s strategic plan in new energy industry, giving full play to the advantages of industrial synergy
and ensuring the supply of battery materials. It’s estimated that after 2035, CATL will be able to meet a significant part of the demand for raw materials by recycling retired battery materials.
