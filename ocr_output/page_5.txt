The Imperative EV Battery Recycling: Alleviation to The Constraint of Upstream Resources

The scarcity of upstream resources is a long-term constraint to the development of downstream application market. The lithium resource supply and
demand gap is expected to emerge and expand gradually after 2025, reaching 145 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2030. EV battery recycling will

alleviate the constraints of resource supply and demand imbalance on industry development to a certain extent.

Supply: resource pressure

Resource shortage in China
High-quality mineral resources are
relatively scarce in China. There are few
high-quality hard rock lithium mines, and
the technology and production capacity of
lithium extraction from salt-lake brine
require breakthroughs.

Uncertainty of international supply
The supply of global raw materials is
concentrated, and the production
fluctuates wildly. Emergencies such as the
epidemic outbreak and the Russian-
Ukrainian conflict have exacerbated the
uncertainty of the global supply chain.

Long capacity development cycle
The development cycle of raw materials
and minerals is relatively long. The
resource production expansion cycle is
about four times that of the EV batteries
expansion cycle, thus leading to the
mismatch between supply and demand.

— Demand: surging EV market ———

Strong application demand

The EV market, as the main application
scenario of lithium resources, has entered
a period of rapid growth, and the sales
volume of EVs in China increased by more
than 150% year-on-year in 2021.

Difficulty in alternative R&D

The R&D of EV batteries with different
chemicals is challenging. In the long run,
Li-batteries, which have a relatively fixed
demand for mineral resources, will still be
the mainstay, and it is hard to find an
alternative solution in the short term.

Intensive competition

Battery companies maintain a rapid pace
of expansion to seize market share and
drive the demand for upstream resources,
amid the increasingly fierce competition in
the EV battery industry.
