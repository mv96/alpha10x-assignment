Business model analysis

Battery manufacturers, as the primary recycler of EV batteries, have
arranged the recycling network by establishing subsidiaries, acquiring
recycling enterprises, industrial cooperation, etc. to form circular
recycling of EV batteries, realize the cost reduction of recycling, and
mitigate the bargaining power of upstream raw material suppliers

Diversified recycling and resale channels are critical factors for battery
manufacturers to effectively control the directional circulation of end-
of-life batteries and reduce the recycling and reproduction costs of EV
batteries

Technical restrictions on self-recycling. Due to the dependence of
crucial recycling technologies on recycling enterprises, the operation
efficiency of the model is usually low, which further hinders the
formation of the scale effect
