Key Takeaways

With the rapid growth of global new energy vehicle industry, the upstream resource constraint has become one of the burning issues. While various countries continue to perfect the EV battery
recycling policy system under the carbon neutral requirements, the EV battery recycling industry has been flourishing, and the upcoming battery retirement tide will further drive the development of
the EV battery recycling industry. The EV battery recycling market is promising in technology development, business model, and industry chain synergy, but there are still many key challenges.

From the technology development perspective, the process and technical route of EV battery recycling is relatively clear. Based on actual business expectations,
direct recycle will dominate the recovery method in the medium- to long-term:

The two main ways of EV battery recycling are reuse and direct recycle. The large-scale development of reuse faces enormous challenges due to safety issues, insufficient market regulation, the

impact of vicious competition, and the lack of industry standards. In the medium- to long-term, recycle with relatively mature technologies and commercial applications is expected to be the
dominant approach

In the material recovery process, pyro- and hydro-metallurgy are the mainstream battery-grade raw material purification and regeneration techniques, which has high technical and scale

barriers, while creating higher economic benefits, leading companies need to address the supply stability of front-end battery recycling channels and actively layout raw material recycling
capacity to achieve higher commercial value

@ From the business model perspective, third-party and battery manufacturer recycling have been well-practiced. The construction of recycling networks and
closed-loop regeneration are essential success factors:

The market mechanism is the main challenge for the current development of the EV battery recycling industry. It forces the leading recycler enterprises to enhance their scale and break
through the profitability bottleneck

Third-party recycling companies have the advantage of recycling technology, while battery manufacturers and automotive OEMs gained the advantage of recycling and resale channels; in the
current EV battery recycling market, the key to successful business models lies in the construction of recycling channel networks and a closed-loop ecology for recycling materials for reuse

From the industry chain synergy perspective, the multiple sectors of the Li-battery and NEV industry chain have shown the trend of extending to battery recycling
in different forms and degrees:

Upstream lithium and new energy vehicle industry technology and market trends, such as battery material innovation, integration technology, battery banks, etc., bring impact to the power
battery recycling industry, and opportunities and challenges coexist

An industry alliance of upstream and downstream enterprises in the industry chain may be an ideal model for the recycling industry, as each member enterprise can complement each other’s
strengths and weaknesses for mutual benefits. However, due to the long industry chain and many stakeholders involved, the model is still in the exploration stage of actual commercial operation

The Imperative EV Battery Recycling: Alleviation to The Constraint of Upstream Resources

The scarcity of upstream resources is a long-term constraint to the development of downstream application market. The lithium resource supply and
demand gap is expected to emerge and expand gradually after 2025, reaching 145 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2030. EV battery recycling will

alleviate the constraints of resource supply and demand imbalance on industry development to a certain extent.

Supply: resource pressure

Resource shortage in China
High-quality mineral resources are
relatively scarce in China. There are few
high-quality hard rock lithium mines, and
the technology and production capacity of
lithium extraction from salt-lake brine
require breakthroughs.

Uncertainty of international supply
The supply of global raw materials is
concentrated, and the production
fluctuates wildly. Emergencies such as the
epidemic outbreak and the Russian-
Ukrainian conflict have exacerbated the
uncertainty of the global supply chain.

Long capacity development cycle
The development cycle of raw materials
and minerals is relatively long. The
resource production expansion cycle is
about four times that of the EV batteries
expansion cycle, thus leading to the
mismatch between supply and demand.

Difficulty in alternative R&D

The R&D of EV batteries with different
chemicals is challenging. In the long run,
Li-batteries, which have a relatively fixed
demand for mineral resources, will still be
the mainstay, and it is hard to find an
alternative solution in the short term.

Intensive competition

Battery companies maintain a rapid pace
of expansion to seize market share and
drive the demand for upstream resources,
amid the increasingly fierce competition in
the EV battery industry.

Recycle: Mainstream Battery-grade Material Extraction Techniques

Recycling enterprises generally refine the valuable metals in end-of-life EV batteries through hydro or pyro-metallurgy, which are highly-technical maturity
and with clear steps, while other emerging processes, such as biological processes and supercritical CO, extraction, are still in the early stages of research
and development; currently, in China, EV battery recycling enterprises’ processes are mainly based on hydro

Use high-temperature to convert metal oxides end-of-life in battery
materials to metals or metal compounds, which proceeds to condensation
and refining. Pyro has high compatibility and is applicable to large-scale

recycling of various types of end-of-life Li-batteries.

* Use acids to dissolve the metal components of batteries and then separate
the constituent elements as inorganic salts and metallic oxide through

solvent extractions, chemical precipitation, and electrolysis steps. Hydro is
suitable for the recycling of small and medium-scale end-of-life batteries.

breakthroughs currently, and it is challenging to achieve economies of scale. It is projected that the
recycling market of NMC batteries will continue to lead in the short and medium term.

Business model analysis

Battery manufacturers, as the primary recycler of EV batteries, have
arranged the recycling network by establishing subsidiaries, acquiring
recycling enterprises, industrial cooperation, etc. to form circular
recycling of EV batteries, realize the cost reduction of recycling, and
mitigate the bargaining power of upstream raw material suppliers

Diversified recycling and resale channels are critical factors for battery
manufacturers to effectively control the directional circulation of end-
of-life batteries and reduce the recycling and reproduction costs of EV
batteries

Technical restrictions on self-recycling. Due to the dependence of
crucial recycling technologies on recycling enterprises, the operation
efficiency of the model is usually low, which further hinders the
formation of the scale effect

Business Model: OEM-led Industrial Alliance as Recycler

The industrial alliance model could be an ideal business model and is led mainly by OEMs. By leveraging the distribution service network and recycling

technology of the member enterprises in the industrial chain, the recycling alliance can achieve a cost-effective and scalable recycling business and reduce
vicious competition in the market. However, this model is still in the initial trial stage of commercial operation, given that various stakeholders are involved

Business model analysis

The industrial chain’s upstream and downstream alliance members
are the primary recycler of EV batteries. The alliance is the inevitable
consequence of the Extended Producer Responsibility and the
industrial collaborative cooperation mode driven by recycling
economics. OEMs often adopt this mode to build a recycling network
through alliances to form a closed loop of the industrial chain.

Extensive recycling channels and strong technical expertise. Through
industrial collaboration, the vicious competition in the market, the cost
of vehicle production, battery manufacturing and material recycling
has been effectively reduced, and the overall recycling efficiency and
mode operation efficiency have been improved

The negative impact of risk sharing is evident in this model. Members
are bound by each other through industrial alliances. Enterprises need

to bear the potential risks that other members of the battery recycling
chain may bring, like uneven expertise.

Market challenges
and business implications

==HEADER PAGE 28==
Challenge-facing EV battery recycling industry

Technical challenges and market mechanism challenges coexist in the recycling industry. Thus, many problems are still to be solved in each sector of the EV
battery recycling industry chain. The healthy development of the EV battery recycling market is in urgent need of the guidance of macro policies and the
joint efforts of all individual parties in the industry chain

@ Difficulties in channel construction @ High cost of reintegration and utilization @ Price uncertainty of raw materials
Establishing a stable recycling channel is one of the recycling Only after disassembly, screening, re-integration, and other processes The price of recycled materials is affected by
companies’ most crucial success factors. The establishment can the end-of-life batteries that meet the standard be put into reuse. the double influence of the cost of recycling
problem of the recycling channel significantly exposed due to the In addition, a series of costs such as battery management and logistics end-of-life batteries and the cost generated
asymmetric information between the upstream enterprises with transportation lead to limited profit margins from the recycling process. The frequent
battery resources and the downstream recycling companies fluctuation of the price of metal raw materials
will also affect the attractiveness of recycled
materials, and the uncertainty of the price
poses severe challenges to the downstream
application of recycled materials

Uncertain downstream demand due to security concerns
Subjected to the application scenarios and the application enterprise’s
concern about the potential safety hazard of secondary battery
utilization, the reuse of end-of-life batteries is weaker than expected

Recycling cost challenges

At present, pricing mechanisms for the recycled end-of-life
batteries are lacking, and the poor transparency causes the new
batteries materials purchasing prices to drop away from the resale
prices of recycled materials

Lack of standards

Technical challenges of battery diversity

Source: Deloitte analysis

© 2022. For information, contact Deloitte China.

Types of power batteries are varied, from battery materials to
internal structures and assembly techniques. The lack of unified
standards poses challenges to the evaluation of end-of-life batteries

Data source barriers

Third-party recyclers are challenging to obtain the data of end-of-
life batteries from vehicle or battery manufacturers, which
increases the difficulty of battery state estimation, remaining useful
life prediction and safety assessment

The disassembly and recovery technology process directly affect the
recovery rate of high-value metals. The diversity of batteries will also
bring technical difficulties. Moreover, the company needs to address
the energy consumption and the environmental impact of the process

Difficulty to scale up due to unstable recycling channels

The massive investment in capacity construction in the early stage
requires the companies to reach a specific scale of recycling end-of-life
batteries to avoid significant profit pressure

Impact of upstream lithium battery and NEV industry trends on EV battery recycling

As the upstream industry, the technology and market trend of lithium battery and NEV industry are closely interrelated to the EV battery recycling

Related Trends of the EV battery recycling upstream industry

Impact on EV battery recycling industry

Rising prices of raw >
materials

The productivity growth of upstream metal resource exploitation is lower than
that of downstream application industries, and the mismatch between resource
supply and demand is significant, leading to metal price fluctuations

The critical metals in battery manufacturing can be recycled from end-of-life
batteries, effectively supplement the shortage of resources, and promote the
development of the recycling industry from the demand side

Rapid iteration of »>
battery chemistry .

High nickelization and low cobalt of ternary batteries and Li-battery
alternatives, which correspondingly reduce the dependence on precious
elements through material innovation, are global R&D hot topics.

The installation of LFP battery increases rapidly due to its cost and safety
advantages

The fast innovation of battery technology and the diversity of specifications raise
the difficulty of battery disassembly and recycling

The cost reduction trend of batteries may bring challenges to the profitability of
the recycling industry, promote recycling companies to develop more efficient
recycling technologies and models

Battery pack technologies such as module-free design (CTP) and battery chassis
integration technology (CTC) improve space utilization and mileage range and
achieve high efficiency and cost reduction

Groundswell of the opinion of EV and battery pack standardization, but
standardization itself is proceeding slowly.

Highly integrated and structural batteries have increased the difficulty of
battery disassembly and technical barriers to recovery. The vehicle companies
and their partners will take on greater responsibility for recycling

The standardization of battery packs will benefit the automatic disassembly
process of batteries, promoting the standardization process of battery recycling
